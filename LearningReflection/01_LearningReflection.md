## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- I wrote the test cases step by step kind of style. First I created test scenarios and  then documented them in vs-code. Each test case included clear steps and expected results.
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 - For test case management, tools like Jira is effective.

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- If I need to automate these test cases in the future, I would consider using Selenium with Java or Python. Selenium is well-known for its robust support in web application testing, offering a wide range of functionalities. Java and Python, on the other hand, are popular programming languages with extensive libraries and community support, making them ideal choices for test automation projects.



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- The most in-demand skills and competencies for software testing roles include proficiency in test automation tools/frameworks (such as Selenium, Cypress, TestNG), understanding of agile methodologies, strong problem-solving skills, knowledge of programming languages (such as Java, Python), experience with continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, and excellent communication and collaboration skills.







## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
